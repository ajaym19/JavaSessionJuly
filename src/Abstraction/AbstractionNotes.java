	 * 2 ways to achieve;
	 * 1. Abstract Class
	 * 2. Interface: similar to class, blueprint
	 * contains only methods with no implementations
	 * cannot create an object of Interface
	 * a class which is implementing the interface
	 * is responsible to implement all the methods of the interface
	 * any method without a body is called as Abstract Method
	 * to create abstract method we use abstract keyword
